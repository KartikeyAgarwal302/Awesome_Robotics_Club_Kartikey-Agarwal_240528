In this task, I created a Python program to help a robot find the best way to move from a starting point (S) to a goal point (G) on a 10×10 grid. Each tile on the grid has a different type of land—some are easy to move through, like free tiles (.), while others like mud (~) and hills (^) are slower and cost more to cross. Walls (#) cannot be crossed at all. To solve this, I used the A* (A-star) algorithm, which is a smart method that helps the robot choose the most cost-efficient path. It does this by looking at how far the robot has already gone and how far it still needs to go, choosing the best option at each step. The program checks many possible paths and picks the one with the lowest total cost, not just the shortest in distance. It prints each step the robot takes and shows the final cost. After running the program, the robot found a complete path from start to goal with a total cost of 17, which is the best possible cost for this grid.
